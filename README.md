# Sorting algorithms

In this project I'm saving my implementation of the theoretical sorting algorithms I learned in my algorithms and datastructures class of Summer 2022.

# Currently Implemented
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort (although not closly looked at in the lecture)
- Merge sort

Every Algorithm is commented in a way to try to make it easy to understand how the algorithm works, and what it does.

# Testing
The project includes a test case for every sorting algorithm that uses the same randomly created 25 Element array.

It outputs the unsorted array, then the results of every sorting algorithm, and then the unsorted array again to show that the algorithms did not get an already sorted array.
